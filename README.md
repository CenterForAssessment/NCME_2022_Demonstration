# NCME 2022 Demonstration

## Using GitHub for Open-Source Analytics, Reporting, and Dissemination of Research

This GitHub repo provides source code associated with the NCME group demonstration showcasing
novel uses of GitHub for promoting research in educational assessment. Specifically, we present a
series of public GitHub repositories that researchers can easily customize for their own uses.

These repositories are structured such that researchers with a basic understanding of GitHub and R
can either (a) modify a set of parameters and efficiently run a comprehensive analysis, or (b)
leverage the basic repository structure to develop and disseminate their own suite of analytic tools.
Across all demonstrations, we expand beyond the basics of GitHub repositories to highlight unique
applications of the platform to educational assessment data.

The four demonstrations are described below linking to their individual repos and presentations:

### Building and Distributing an R package using GitHub

Perhaps the greatest strength of [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) is its extensibility, with the ability
to expand base R in innumerable ways. Although building your first R package can be a daunting task, doing so
tames analytic complexity and adds fidelity to any data-related task in which one engages. In this
demonstration, [Damian Betebenner](https://github.com/dbetebenner) presents how to quickly build
your first R package from a package skeleton on GitHub. Building a package using a GitHub repository
has many advantages, including

* better code maintenance,
* easy distribution of the package to other users, and
* online documentation via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)


The repo containing the package skeleton is located [here](https://github.com/dbetebenner/customizedPackageForR).

### Using GitHub Pages to Collate and Disseminate Data Analysis

GitHub allows users to collate their analyses into a user-friendly, distribution-ready website.
In this demonstration we show how to researchers can leverage [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and
author-written R packages (also available through GitHub), to host vignettes, source code for
statistical analyses, presentations, and project updates. Furthermore, researchers can easily customize the
website layout to match a desired style. Additionally, being web-hosted, all content is
immediately available with source code. In the demonstration, we present an example website
created during a summer internship program. We then walk through the basic set-up of a
skeleton website within RStudio, including how to incorporate new pages and structure the
webpage navigation. We also discuss the benefits of developing a project website for promoting collaboration
and reproducible research practices.

### Using GitHub and RMarkdown for Report Generation and Dissemination

Data analysts are often tasked with writing reports that
describe data, analyses, and results associated with a project. Depending upon the nature of the
project, such reports are either completely customized or borrow heavily from other reports (e.g.,
annual reports). GitHub repositories and associated GitHub actions can be used to coordinate the
writing as well as the production of final reports for dissemination. The process we demonstrate
utilizes R, R Markdown, and several associated R packages as the base tools to construct these
reports.

### Using GitHub to consolodate the analysis and dissemination of research

This demonstration illustrates how researchers can use a single GitHub
repository to design, analyze, and disseminate educational research from start to finish. This
omnibus repository incorporates a suite of tools, such as author-written R packages and
automated report generation, that can be easily customized to fit a particular project. Using an
example repository designed for educational assessment research, we showcase how users can
organize and share their project with interested researchers. In this demonstration, we emphasize
the multiple ways in which an omnibus project repository exemplifies the advantages of opensource
research. Even the most complex projects can be supported using this version control
repository structure, allowing multiple analysts and researchers to seamlessly support and
combine results from various research tasks.
