# NCME 2022 Demonstration: Using GitHub for Open-Source Analytics, Reporting, and Dissemination of Research

## Building and Distributing an R package using GitHub

Perhaps the greatest strength of [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) is its extensibility, with the ability
to expand base R in innumerable ways. Although building your first R package can be a daunting task, doing so
tames analytic complexity and adds fidelity to any data-related task in which one engages. In this
demonstration, [Damian Betebenner](https://github.com/dbetebenner) presents how to quickly build
your first R package from a package skeleton on GitHub. Building a package using a GitHub repository
has many advantages, including

* better code maintenance,
* easy distribution of the package to other users, and
* online documentation via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
