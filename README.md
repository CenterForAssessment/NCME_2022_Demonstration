# NCME 2022 Demonstration

## Using GitHub for Open-Source Analytics, Reporting, and Dissemination of Research

This GitHub repo provides source code associated with the NCME group demonstration showcasing
novel uses of GitHub for promoting research in educational assessment. Specifically, we present a
series of public GitHub repositories that researchers can easily customize for their own uses.

These repositories are structured such that researchers with a basic understanding of GitHub and R
can either (a) modify a set of parameters and efficiently run a comprehensive analysis, or (b)
leverage the basic repository structure to develop and disseminate their own suite of analytic tools.
Across all demonstrations, we expand beyond the basics of GitHub repositories to highlight unique
applications of the platform to educational assessment data.

The four demonstrations are described below linking to their individual repos and presentations:

### Building and Distributing an R package using GitHub

Perhaps the greatest strength of [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) is its extensibility, with the ability
to expand base R in innumerable ways. Although building your first R package can be a daunting task, doing so
tames analytic complexity and adds fidelity to any data-related task in which one engages. In this
demonstration, [Damian Betebenner](https://github.com/dbetebenner) presents how to quickly build
your first R package from a package skeleton on GitHub. Building a package using a GitHub repository
has many advantages, including

* better code maintenance,
* easy distribution of the package to other users, and
* online documentation via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

### Using GitHub Pages to disseminate


### Using GitHub and RMarkdown for Report Generation and Dissemination


### Using GitHub to consolodate the analysis and dissemination of research
